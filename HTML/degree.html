            <p class="line"> As I mentioned on a homepage my course is Computer Science with Year in Industry, to be
                more specific I'm doing BSc. The current semesters consist of 6 modules that, each of them will have
                small section below. If you want more information on my course I'd avise checking out <a
                    href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/2021/computer-science-year-industry-bsc">official
                    course page</a> (the link leads to the one for 21/22, but I doubt there is much diffrence with one
                I'm taking)

            <p class="line">COM1001 - Introduction to Software Engineering. This module focuses on how to be a good
                Software Engineer, a lot of its content is related to how to organize your work flow and work in the
                team in a way that wont hinder your project. Except that there is plenty of Ruby and Linux command
                promt, which are vital for any Software Engineer.</p>

            <p class="line">COM1002 - Foundations of Computer Science. This module focuses mostly on logic and logic
                related subjects. For example how to write in logical statements that All people taking COM1002 are also
                taking COM1008. There isn't much "practical" work in a sense that you don't programme anything or write
                code or anykind. But the module still provides really important knwoledge for any aspiring Computer
                Scientist.</p>

            <p class="line">COM1003 - Java Programming. This module focuses on, just like the name implies Java. The
                module has tons of practical work, so a lot of code is written. At first writting in Java was hard, but
                after a week or two of writting basic programs it's easy to grasp basics of synatx and write more
                complicated code.</p>

                work, types of it and how to develop your own AI. Unlike other models first half of the semester in
                COM1005 was purely about history of AI and it's development. It might seem boring for some, but it's
                vital that we know how the discipline changed and developed in the previous years.</p>

                work. Logical gates and how to build more advanced devices out of them. Did you know that you could
                build anything just from NAND gates? That's one of the things we learnt during this semester (and how to
                prove this using logic).</p>
